# Broadcast Logger - Project State

## Project Overview
Broadcast Logger is a system designed to debug Ethernet broadcast packet delivery in Layer 2 networks. It consists of two main components:
1. A broadcast sender (server)
2. Multiple broadcast receivers (clients)

## Current Architecture

### Server Component
- Written in Go
- Provides HTTP API for client registration and control
- Sends broadcast packets with unique identifiers
- Tracks connected clients and their status
- Endpoints:
  - `/broadcast`: Sends a broadcast packet and reports delivery
  - `/status`: Reports current state of all clients
  - `/report`: Endpoint for clients to report received packets

### Client Component
- Written in Go
- Registers with server via HTTP
- Listens for broadcast packets
- Reports received packets back to server
- Configurable client ID and server connection

### Network Architecture
- Server and clients communicate over two channels:
  1. HTTP control traffic (port 8080) over public network
  2. UDP broadcast traffic (port 9999) over private network
- All components are designed to run in a Layer 2 network environment
- Using Digital Ocean's private network interface (eth1) for broadcast traffic
- Broadcast traffic sent to 10.0.0.255 (broadcast address for 10.0.0.0/16 network)
- HTTP control traffic uses server's public IP for cross-droplet communication

## Infrastructure (Digital Ocean)

### Current Setup
- Terraform-managed infrastructure
- Components:
  - 1x Server droplet (s-2vcpu-2gb)
  - 8x Client droplets (s-1vcpu-1gb)
  - Private VPC network (10.0.0.0/16)
  - SSH key-based access

### Deployment Process
1. Infrastructure is defined in Terraform
2. User data scripts handle:
   - Go environment setup
   - Application installation
   - Service startup
3. Automatic client registration with server

### Known Infrastructure Issues
1. Go build environment:
   - Required explicit GOCACHE configuration
   - Needed HOME directory setting
   - Required GOPATH configuration
   - All environment variables now properly set in user data scripts

## Current State

### Working Features
- Basic server and client functionality
- Client registration system
- Broadcast packet sending
- Client reporting system
- Status monitoring
- Infrastructure automation

### Recent Changes
1. Infrastructure:
   - Reduced client count from 128 to 8 for testing
   - Added proper Go environment configuration
   - Implemented private VPC networking
   - Added SSH key management
   - Configured eth1 as broadcast interface for all components
   - Added explicit broadcast address (10.0.0.255) for UDP traffic
   - Updated client configuration to use server's public IP for HTTP communication

2. Application:
   - Enhanced `/status` endpoint with last_packet_id
   - Separated control and test traffic
   - Added client metadata support
   - Added broadcast interface and IP configuration

### Known Issues
1. Infrastructure:
   - Need to verify Go build success across all droplets
   - May need to implement health checks
   - Consider adding monitoring for long-running tests

2. Application:
   - Need to verify broadcast packet delivery in Digital Ocean's network
   - May need to adjust network settings for optimal broadcast performance
   - Consider adding more detailed logging for network issues

## Next Steps

### Short Term
1. Verify successful deployment of all components
2. Test broadcast packet delivery in Digital Ocean environment
3. Implement basic monitoring
4. Add health check endpoints

### Medium Term
1. Scale up to full 128 client deployment
2. Add performance metrics collection
3. Implement automated testing
4. Add network diagnostics tools

### Long Term
1. Consider containerization
2. Implement CI/CD pipeline
3. Add comprehensive monitoring
4. Create detailed documentation

## Cost Considerations
Current infrastructure costs (as of 2024):
- Server (s-2vcpu-2gb): $12/month
- Clients (s-1vcpu-1gb): $6/month each
- Current test setup (8 clients): $60/month
- Full deployment (128 clients): $780/month

## Security Notes
- All droplets are in a private VPC
- SSH key-based access only
- No public ports exposed except necessary services
- Consider implementing additional security measures for production use

## Monitoring Needs
1. Server health
2. Client connectivity
3. Broadcast packet delivery rates
4. Network performance metrics
5. Resource utilization

## Documentation Status
- Basic README.md in place
- Terraform documentation complete
- Need to add:
  - API documentation
  - Network architecture diagrams
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Performance tuning guide
